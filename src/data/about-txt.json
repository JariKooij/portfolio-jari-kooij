"Hi there! My name is Jari Kooij, and I am a third year software engineering student at Windesheim University of Applied Sciences and recently started working as a Junior Software Developer at Het Medialab. I like to experiment with new technologies and find it super rewarding and motivating to learn new skills and develop myself further. \n\nMy primary interest lies in the design and implementation of the front-end of applications, where I can truly express my creativity. For this, I use tools such as TypeScript, Next.js, SCSS and Figma. With a background in digital art, specifically Photoshop compositing and graphic design, I have the ability to convey a message to the user using imagery, composition and color. I get a lot of satisfaction from creating something that captivates and engages people, because of striking visuals, an interesting concept or a compelling story."
